# PasswordGenerator
Password Generating application

## Description
Was asked to build an application that can generate a randomized passwords.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This application will prompt the user how many characters they want their password to be, then it will prompt if they want lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters included in the password. If the user does not want certain criteria to be included in their password all they need to do is hit 'cancel' on that prompt and move on to the next.
